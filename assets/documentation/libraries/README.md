| library_polymerase | Specify the polymerases that were applied after indexing the library - write the source, if we take it not from the article. - can be in the amplification kit | fastpfu polymerase | db_common | "type": "string", <br> "pattern": "^([^A-Z]*\|None\|unknown)$" |
| library_treatment | The type of library processing to repair the damage. <br> Indicated in the article | user | db_common | Specified in an enum <br> [(link)](https://github.com/agni-bioinformatics-lab/OilMetagenomesDB/blob/main/schemas_libraries/library_treatment.json) |
| library_concentration | This is the number of copies of qPCR per mkl of the extract of this library. <br> If the library has been sequenced several times, then you can duplicate the value for each library. Is it a nanogram per microliter or a copy per microliter | 41700000.1 | db_common | "type": "string", <br> "pattern": "^(\\\d+\\\\.\\\d+\|None\|unknown)$" |
| PCR_cycle_count | Number of PCR cycles | 25 | db_common | "type": "string", <br> "pattern": "^(\\\d+\|None\|unknown)$" |
| instrument_model | Sequencer model. <br> Specified in the article | illumina hiseq4000 | db_common | Specified in an enum <br> [(link)](https://github.com/agni-bioinformatics-lab/OilMetagenomesDB/blob/main/schemas_libraries/instrument_model.json) |
| library_layout | The sequencing method (one-sided or two-sided) can be understood by the number of FASTQ files (1 or 2, respectively) | paired | article_common | Specified in an enum <br> [(link)](https://github.com/agni-bioinformatics-lab/OilMetagenomesDB/blob/main/schemas_libraries/library_layout.json) |
| library_strategy | Research strategy | amplicon | db_common | Specified in an enum <br> [(link)](https://github.com/agni-bioinformatics-lab/OilMetagenomesDB/blob/main/schemas_libraries/library_strategy.json) |
| amplicon_variable_region | Variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene, which are used to identify taxa of bacteria and archaea. <br> Specified in the article | v3-v4 | db_common | "type": "string", <br> pattern": "^(None\|unknown\|(v[1-9]\|v1-v2\|v2-v3\|v3-v4\|v4-v5\|v5-v6\|v6-v7\|v7-v8\|v8-v9\|v1-v3\|v6-v8)(, ?(v[1-9]\|v1-v2\|v2-v3\|v3-v4\|v3-v5\|v4-v5\|v5-v6\|v6-v7\|v7-v8\|v8-v9\|v1-v3\|v6-v8))*)$" |
| read_count | How many reads are in the FASTQ files. <br> Finds the parser | 215326 | article_uniq | "type": "string", <br> "pattern": "^(\\\d+)$" |
